# A simple nuclear reactor
<br>
This project mimics the behavior of a nuclear reactor's temperature by using promises to delay the timing of a temperature change.
<br>
Start the main pump and pull the control rods out.  Watch the temperature of the "hot leg" (output from the reactor) increase, while the "cold leg" (input side, right after the pump) reaches that temperature more slowly.
<br>
Future improvements could include programming in the behavior of steam demand on the whole plant.
